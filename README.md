# AI-Powered Crop Disease Diagnosis System

Empowering smallholder farmers with an AI mobile app to detect and diagnose crop diseases from leaf images — offline and in real-time.

---

##  Overview

Crop disease is a major contributor to food insecurity, particularly among small-scale farmers who lack access to timely diagnosis tools.  
This project leverages deep learning and computer vision to identify diseases in leaves of common Kenyan crops (e.g., maize, tomato, beans).  
Farmers capture an image via a mobile app and receive immediate feedback—even offline.
